Findings from Global Health Expenditure Project

*In 2020, Monaco Exhibited the Highest Health Expenditure:
- In the year 2020, Monaco recorded the highest health expenditure among all countries in our dataset. 
  This suggests a significant investment in healthcare within the country during that year.


*In 2018 and 2019, Luxembourg Led in Health Expenditure:
- During the years 2018 and 2019, Luxembourg consistently had the highest health expenditure among the countries studied. 
  This indicates a pattern of robust healthcare investment during this period.

*Democratic Republic of Congo Maintained the Lowest Health Expenditure:
- Throughout the study period (2018, 2019, and 2020), the Democratic Republic of Congo consistently had the lowest health expenditure. 
   This highlights the challenges in healthcare financing within the country.

*Variation in Health Expenditure Growth:
- Between 2018 and 2019, there was a slight decline (-0.12%) in health expenditure. 
  However, from 2019 to 2020, there was a substantial increase (10.3%) in health expenditure.
- The average annual growth rate of health expenditure from 2019 to 2020 was 5.09%, indicating a significant uptick in healthcare spending during that period.

*Geographical Disparities in Health Expenditure:
- Most countries with health expenditure levels below $10,000  are primarily located in Africa, Asia, and South America. 
  This suggests limited healthcare resources in these regions.
- In contrast, countries with health expenditure exceeding $10,000 are primarily situated in Europe, indicating a higher level of healthcare investment in European nations.

*Increasing Health Expenditure Over Time:
- A line chart analysis demonstrates a consistent increase in health expenditure across most countries from 2018 to 2020. 
   This indicates a global trend of rising healthcare investment.

*Positive Correlation Between Expenditure and GDP:
- A scatter plot analysis reveals a positive correlation between health expenditure and GDP from 2018 to 2020. 
   This suggests that countries with higher GDP tend to allocate more resources to healthcare, reinforcing the link between economic prosperity and healthcare investment.

These findings provide valuable insights into the global landscape of health expenditure, showcasing variations across countries, changes over time, 
and the relationship between economic indicators and healthcare spending.
